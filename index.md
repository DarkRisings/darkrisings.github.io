# Welcome to a New World

## Our Vision
To build a safe, fun and progressive game designed by and for the players at large.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to engage players in interesting and innovative storylines within the realm of Rhia. We provide the utmost transparency with projects in the works. Staff will facilitate player run initiatives, and create new stories too. Both will work in tandem to create the stories we tell one another

# Ushering in a New Era of Transparency
We believe that you have the right to understand the game you are playing, and we also don't want to be overlords. At this point, MUDs are a dying breed and the only reason anybody plays them anymore is nostalgia. We're not monetizing anything, there's no reason to hide the code behind super duper secret locked doors. We're all in this together, and the game is as much yours as it is ours. 

That is why, if you click "Source Code" in the header, you will be taken to the git repository which contains a public copy of Dark Risings source files.

This page also serves as a place to report coding issues and discuss possible feature additions in the issue tab. We also have a Wiki there that may get utilized. The projects section will show you a list of things in active development. 

If you have an idea, complaint, request or just want to talk about some aspect of the game's mechanics, go ahead and start an issue. If the majority agrees on the change you are proposing, the issue will be moved to open projects.

# Confused?
### Here is our announcement that explains why we are doing this

There is a secondary Dark Risings now in production at 174.138.76.27:1313. It is complete with all areas, code, player files, histories and a full staff including Admin/Imp/Coder/RP. There are about 9 of us. 9 players on an already thinning player base that were driven away.

**OUR OPENING STATEMENT**

The existing staff of DR does, we are sure, mean well. However, we find ourselves at a place where many of us are banned from the game, due to transgressions as old as 3 years. Others of us have had the stories we worked so hard to build, in some cases for over a decade, torn away from us. Still others have had our characters stripped of dignity and thrown out of guilds we patroned for literal decades. The rest were repulsed by downright puerile acts of power grabbing.  Our opinions and contributions didn’t matter, our characters didn’t fit someone else’s vision, and it was made clear to us that we had no home at DR anymore.

And we're told we can't ever have it back. We're either told we're not welcome to play their game anymore, or we feel that it isn't the same, and doesn't satisfy the nostalgia that kept us coming back for so many years. And they are unwilling to work with us or negotiate at all in any way that’s significant.

But this game belongs to ALL OF US, not 2 people. So together we have come up with a vision statement and mission statement for where we want to take the game ourselves. It all boils down to the same thing: What's good for the players. 

So going into this, we promise a few things:
- No more arbitrary bans or rule enforcement.  We will be transparent.
- Old bans are rescinded.  We are looking for a fresh start.
- We will be transparent about the codebase and coming changes.  It’s important to us that you understand how the game you play works.
Guilds will be run by mortal leadership.  You ultimately make this game fun, and should be running the guilds you choose to join to make that happen.
- Staff will consist of an IMP, an Admin, a Coder, and a couple of imms for roleplay and general purposes that make your experience more interactive and fun. We want to strip away the old corruption that plagued DR’s staff from time to time, and create an environment where it cannot reappear.

All are welcome. See you soon.

Viva la Resistance!
