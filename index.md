# Welcome to a New World

## Our Vision
To build a safe, fun and progressive game designed by and for the players at large.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to engage players in interesting and innovative storylines within the realm of Rhia. We provide the utmost transparency with projects in the works. Staff will facilitate player run initiatives, and create new stories too. Both will work in tandem to create the stories we tell one another

# Ushering in a New Era of Transparency
We believe that you have the right to understand the game you are playing, and we also don't want to be overlords. At this point, MUDs are a dying breed and the only reason anybody plays them anymore is nostalgia. We're not monetizing anything, there's no reason to hide the code behind super duper secret locked doors. We're all in this together, and the game is as much yours as it is ours. 

That is why, if you click "Source Code" in the header, you will be taken to the git repository which contains a public copy of Dark Risings source files.

This page also serves as a place to report coding issues and discuss possible feature additions in the issue tab. We also have a Wiki there that may get utilized. The projects section will show you a list of things in active development. 

If you have an idea, complaint, request or just want to talk about some aspect of the game's mechanics, go ahead and start an issue. If the majority agrees on the change you are proposing, the issue will be moved to open projects.
