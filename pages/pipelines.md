# Pipelines  
Pipelines are essentially coding outlines for new projects. The coding work flow goes something like this: 

- Player or imm submits an idea to everyone via the "Issues" tab on the github repo (https://github.com/DarkRisings/src)
- A discussion takes place
- If the idea is approved, it moves here, to pipelines. 
- Once the pipeline outline is complete, the project will be set up on the "Projects" tab on the github repo, where everyone can track coding progress.

This is where I will map out the system visually before coding it. It allows me to have a guideline to follow, and makes sure everyone is on the same page. Before a project enters the development stage, the pipeline outline must be approved by the majority.

Discussion on specific pipelines is both enabled and encouraged. Feel free to leave comments.
